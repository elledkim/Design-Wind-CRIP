# Design Wind CRIP
 
Design Wind CRIP (Climate Resilient Interface by Princeton) is a web-based tool designed to dynamically calculate climate-resilient design wind speeds by incorporating non-stationary climate data.
The server is not compatible with GitHub, so we are currently in the process of deploying it on to the web through AWS. Link will be added here!
