# Design Wind CRIP
 
<strong>Design Wind CRIP (Climate Resilient Interface by Princeton)</strong> is a web-based tool designed to dynamically calculate climate-resilient design wind speeds by incorporating non-stationary climate data.
The server is not compatible with GitHub, so we are currently in the process of deploying it on to the web through AWS. <br>

Test out the current version here: http://54.210.189.11:5000/ <br><br>

Things coming soon:
<ul>
 <li>ASCE 7-16 and 7-22 data</li>
 <li>Option to generate difference maps comparing methods straight from the site</li>
 <li>Historical tropical cyclone data and comparsion to recommended wind speeds</li>
</ul>
